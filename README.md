# [Portfolio application](https://sorokin-oleg.github.io/portfolio-website/#/)
### A simple application for visualizing my work

This application is a portfolio for my work related to the development of web interfaces.
To a large extent, this is an educational application, in which I experimented with the methods of creating React applications.

#### The application used the following technologies:
- [React](https://reactjs.org)
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org)
- [React-Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/quick-start)
- [React-Slick](https://react-slick.neostack.com)
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com)
